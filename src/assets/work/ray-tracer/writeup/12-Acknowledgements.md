### Code

I completed Assignment 4 by following Peter Shirley's book, _Fundamentals of Computer Graphics_, like a bible. Later chapters were also extremely helpful for implementing my project objectives, such as depth of field, refraction, and soft shadows.

I learned refraction from a combination of the chapter in the aforementioned textbook, as well as [this lesson on Scratchapixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-shading/reflection-refraction-fresnel).

My ray tracer was _sort of_ multi-threaded - it worked on my machine and not on the graphics lab computers ðŸ˜…. Nevertheless, the code was taken almost verbatim from [Foster Brereton's article on Medium](https://medium.com/@phostershop/solving-multithreaded-raytracing-issues-with-c-11-7f018ecd76fa).

I changed my ray-triangle intersection algorithm to the MÃ¶ller-Trumbore intersection algorithm, where the code is mostly unchanged from the Implementation section of [their paper](http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~mgattass/cg/trbRR/Fast%20MinimumStorage%20RayTriangle%20Intersection.pdf).

All other textures were created by me.

### Models

The cow and plane meshes came from the Assignment 4 starter code. All other models were created by me.
