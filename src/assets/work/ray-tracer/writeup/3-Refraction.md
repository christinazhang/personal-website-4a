Can't talk about refraction without showing the classic "pen in water" (or in this case, a straw) image! The other two are simply because I think it looks cooler in a sphere, and you can clearly see some reflections from calculating the Fresnel coefficients.

If the material for an object has a refractive index, $\eta$, we first check if total internal reflection is taking place via Snell's Law.

If the incident angle is greater than the critical angle, then all of the light will be reflected. Otherwise, we construct the refracted ray, as well as calculate the Fresnel coefficient for transmittance and reflectance.
