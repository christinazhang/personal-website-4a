In Spring 2019, I took a course that was one of my dream courses, but also the course that I most feared. CS488 is well known at UWaterloo for having a demanding workload, as well as being notoriously difficult to get into. However, I can now say that it is also one of the most rewarding courses Iâ€™ve taken so far, and definitely one of my favourites.

For my final project, I chose to extend the ray tracer we wrote for [Assignment 4](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/gallery-A4.html). Why Animal Crossing? Well, [Assignment 3](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/gallery-A3.html) was to create a puppet - which was basically the 3D successor to an [assignment from CS349](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs349/f18/assignments/a3.html), so I thought it would be nice to use the same character I did for that project: Isabelle from Animal Crossing. And since I already had that asset, I decided to theme (most of) my renders for this project with Animal Crossing in mind. It is also a celebration of the announcement for the newest installment of the Animal Crossing series, Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
