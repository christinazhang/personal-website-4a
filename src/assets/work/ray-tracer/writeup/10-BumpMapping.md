In Animal Crossing, one of the most annoying things to fish up is an [empty can](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Trash?file=HNI_0094_empty_can.jpg). This is a cylinder primitive with a corrugated metal bump map applied. You can also tell that the underlying geometry has not been changed, as the edges of the cylinder are still straight.

Bump mapping is done using Blinn's technique, where the surface normal is perturbed according to the finite difference on a bump map for the associated point $(u, v)$.
