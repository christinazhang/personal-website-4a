## Major Open Question: $P \stackrel{?}{=} NP$

If P = NP:
oops complete later


Almost all "natural" problems in NP are known to be in P or NP-complete.

Exceptions open in Garey & Johnston '79 (very famous book on NP-completeness)
* Linear Programming (in P in 1980)
* Primality (in P in 2002)
* Graph Isomorphism - Still open
  - Given to graphs $G_1 = (V_1, E_1), G_2=(V_2, E_2)$ are they the same graph up to relabelling?

**Some interesting NP-complete problems**
1. Edge colouring:
  * Colour edges of graph s.t. incident edges have different colours
  * If we have degree d => need d colours
  * $\delta$ = max degree => need $\delta$ colours
  * Theorem (by Vizing) that minimum number of colours is either $\delta$ or $\delta + 1$
2. Eric Demaine et al. 2012
  * Nintendo games are NP-hard
    - Reductions from 3-SAT
3. Minimum weight triangulation is NP-hard.
  * Mulzer & Role J.ACM 2008
  * Given points in plane and $k \in \mathbb{N}$ is there a triangulation with sum of edge lengths $\leq k$?

**Open Problems:** Are the following problems NP-complete?
1. Given two binary search trees on leaves 1, ..., n, and given $k \in \mathbb{N}$, can we get from one to the other using $\leq k$ rotations?
2. Given an $n \times n \times n$ Rubik's cube, can we solve it in $\leq k$ moves? - PROVED TO BE COMPLETE IN 2017!
    * "Move" - rotating a slice
    * Note: for $3 \times 3 \times 3$ the question of polynomial time algorithm is moot, because there's a finite set of possibilities.

## What to do with NP-Hard Problems
* Exhaustive search
  - These are exponential time, but try to cut down on work
* Heuristics
* Pseudo-polynomial time - not very useful
* Approximation algorithms - much more applicable!

### Approximation Algorithms
#### Example 1: Travelling Salesman
For points in a plane with Euclidean distances

![](https://i.imgur.com/miSTm2m.png) Complete graph, weight of edge = Euclidean distance between the points

![](https://i.imgur.com/4q8BqVM.png) The crucial property we need: the triangle inequality from high school! $|ab| + |bc| \geq |ac|$

In general graph, the triangle inequality does not always hold: ![](https://i.imgur.com/OgOmwRW.png)

**Approximation Algorithm:**
* Find a minimum spanning tree (using Kruskal or Prim's algorithm)
* Walk around it (traverse each edge twice)
* Take shortcuts to avoid visiting a vertex more than once

This constructs a tour in polynomial time.

Let $l$ be the length of tour found by this algorithm, and $l_{\text{TSP}}$ be the length of the minimum Travelling Salesman tour.

**Claim:** $l \leq 2l_{\text{TSP}}$
* So in polynomial time we find a tour $\leq$ 2 * minimum tour. This is an *approximation factor* of 2 (we can improve this to 1.5)

**Proof of Claim:**
* Let $l_{\text{MST}}$ be the length of minimum spanning tree.
* $l_{\text{TSP}} \leq l_{\text{MST}}$
* Even removing an edge of the TSP tour still connects all points, and MST is still minimum weight
* $l \leq 2l_{\text{MST}}$ since we walk the MST twice and then take shortcuts.
* Then we combine: $l \leq 2l_{\text{MST}} \leq 2l_{\text{TSP}}$

#### Example 2: Vertex Cover
Pick set of vertices $C$ such that $\forall$ edges $(u, v)$, $u \in C$ or $v \in C$ or both, and minimize $|C|$

**Approximation Algorithm:**
* $C \leftarrow \emptyset, F \leftarrow E$ (F is the uncovered edges)
```
while F is not empty
  pick e = (u, v) in F
  put u and v in C
  remove from F all edges incident to u or v
end
```
This algorithm is polynomial time. Let $C$ = vertex cover found by the algorithm, $C_{\text{OPT}}$ = a minimum vertex cover (not necessarily unique)

**Claim:** $|C| \leq 2|C_{\text{OPT}}|$

**Proof:**
* The set of edges e used by the algorithm is a *matching* - no two edges incident to the same vertex. Let $M$ = this matching.
* $|C| = 2|M|$
* $|M| \leq |C_{\text{OPT}}|$ because each edge in M needs a different vertex to cover it.
* Combining, $|C| \leq 2|C_{\text{OPT}}|$
* So we have an approximation factor of 2.

This 2-approximation does not extend to Independent Set or Clique. (If we could, then *Theorem* P = NP)

***

Sometimes, we can prove that a polynomial time approximation algorithm would imply that $P = NP$

**Example:** General TSP (without the triangle inequality)

Suppose there is a polynomial time algorithm for TSP that gurantees a tour of length $\leq k \cdot l_{\text{TSP}}$.

Use this to give a polynomial time algorithm for Hamiltonian Cycle
* Input: graph G, does G have a Hamiltonian Cycle?
* Make a complete graph
  - $w(u, v) = \begin{cases} 1 \text{ if } (u,v) \in E(G) \\ \text{really large if } (u, v) \notin E(G) \end{cases}$

**Claim:** G has a Hamiltonian cycle iff G' has a TSP tour of length n. From this, we can finish the proof (Anna ran out of time! See notes)
