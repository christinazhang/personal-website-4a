Super Smash Brothers players/Animal Crossing fans will recognize this from [Isabelle's announcement trailer](https://youtu.be/BPDc3yVjfNw?t=73)!

The intensity of light hitting a diffuse material is $n \cdot l$, where $n$ is the normal vector and $l$ is the direction from the intersection point to the light source. This intensity is multiplied by the diffuse colour to achieve shading. When cel shading is turned on, the intensity is sorted into buckets to get discrete changes in colour for a toon effect.

For example, for all values of intensity $i$ where $0.2 < i \leq 0.55$, an intensity of 0.7 is applied.
