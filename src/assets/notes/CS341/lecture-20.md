# Lecture 20

**Definition:** Problem X is *NP-complete* if:
1. $X \in NP$
2. $Y \leq_p X$ for all Y in NP.

**Satisfiability:** 3-SAT is NP-complete.

To show that problem Z is NP-complete:
1. $Z \in NP$
2. $X \leq_p Z$ for some known NP-complete problem X.

Last lecture, we showed that the Independent Set is NP-complete via 3-SAT $\leq_p$ Independent Set.

Independent Set: Given graph $G, k \in \mathbb{N}$ does $G$ have an independent set of size $\geq k$? ![](https://i.imgur.com/G68BSQN.png)

Clique: Given graph $G, k \in \mathbb{N}$, does $G$ have a clique of size $\geq$ k? ![](https://i.imgur.com/t0DgSFf.png)

**Theorem:** Clique problem is NP-complete

**Proof:**
1. Clique $\in$ NP.
* certificate: vertices of clique
* verification algorithm:
	* check $\geq k$ vertices
	* check every pair joined by edge
	* can be done in polynomial time
2. $X \leq_p$ Clique.
* For X a known NP-complete problem, (X = Independent Set)
	* Prove that if there is a polynomial algorithm for Clique, then there is a polynomial time algorithm for Independent Set.
* Algorithm for Independent Set (Using subroutine for Clique)
	* Input: Graph G, $k \in \mathBB{N}$
	* Idea: find a Clique in the complement of G. I will not be drawing a complement of G, because I don't hate myself.
	* Construct $G^c$ - complement of G where we replace edges by non-edges
		* $(u, v) \in E(G)$ iff $(u, v) \notin E(G^c)$
	* Give $G^c, k$ to the Clique subroutine.
	* Return the YES/NO answer.
* This algorithm takes polynomial time.
* Correctness:
	* Claim: G has independent set of size $\geq k$ iff $G^c$ has a clique of size $\geq k$. Proof: see notes

**Vertex Cover:** Given graph $G, k \in \mathbb{n}$, does G have a *vertex cover* of size $\leq k$. Vertex cover - a set of vertices $C$ such that $\forall$ edges (u,v) $u \in c$ or $v\in C$ (or both)

**Theorem:** Vertex Cover is NP-Complete.

**Proof:**
1. Vertex Cover $\in$ NP
* Certificate: set of vertices C
* Verification: $|C| \leq k$
	* and for every edge at least one endpoint is in C
	* This can be done in poly time.
2. Independent Set $\leq_p$ Vertex Cover
* Suppose we have a polynomial time algorithm for Vertex Cover, we will create a polynomial time algorithm for Independent Set.
* Claim: C is a vertex cover iff V \ C is an independent set. (proof is an exercise)
* Algorithm:
	* Give G, n-k as input to Vertex Cover subroutine
	* Return YES/NO answer.
	* Poly time algorithm

Road map of NP-completeness:
* Circuit-SAT $\leq_p$:
	* 3-SAT $\leq_p$:
		* Independent Set $\leq_p$:
			* Clique
			* Vertex Cover
		* Hamiltonian Cycle $\leq_p$:
			* TSP
		* Subset Sum

**Directed Hamiltonian Cycle**
* Input: digraph
* Question: is there a directed cycle going through every vertex once
**Theorem:** Directed Hamiltonian Cycle is NP-compete

Proof:
1. Directed Hamiltonian Cycle $\in$ NP
	* Certificate: the ordered list of vertices
	* Verification: 
		* Every vertex appears once
		* All edges between consecutive pairs & last vertex to first vertex
		* This can be done in polynomial time
2. 3-SAT $\leq_p$ Directed Hamiltonian Cycle
	* Suppose we have a polynomial time algorithm for Directed Hamiltonian Cycle. Design an algorithm for 3-SAT
		* Input: Clauses $C_1, C_2, ..., C_m, C_i = (l_i_1 \lor \l_i_2 \lor l_i_3)$ Variables $x_1 .. x_n$
		* Claim: Any directed Hamiltonian Cycle follwos $x_i$ chain of bubbles forward or backward
		* We must add structure for clauses. 
		* Idea: for the Hamiltonian cycle to visit C, it must use a forward $x_1$ bubble ($x_1 is true) or a backward $x_2$ bubble ($x_2$ false) or forward $x_3$ bubble ($x_3$ true)
		* For details of proof and all the crazy bubble diagrams I did not draw, see notes.
		* Claim: this graph has directed Hamiltonian cycle iff the 3-SAT input is satisfiable.

**Theorem:** undirected Hamiltonian Cycle is NP-complete

**Proof:**
1. $\in$ NP
2. Directed Hamiltonian Cycle $\leq_p$ Undirected Hamiltonian Cycle

**Idea:** Replace each vertex with a 2-edge thing (draw later)
